    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on extracting **real-time smartphone data from Flipkart** using Python web scraping techniques (BeautifulSoup, Requests). The smartphone industry is highly competitive, with frequent product launches, fluctuating prices, and diverse customer preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes product names, prices, discounts, ratings, and technical specifications, which are further cleaned and prepared for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal is to visualize market trends in Power BI, providing insights into -\n",
    "- Price distribution across smartphone models\n",
    "- Discount patterns for different brands\n",
    "- Consumer rating behavior\n",
    "- Key feature comparisons (RAM, Battery, Display, Processor, Camera)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project simulates an end-to-end data analysis workflow — from raw web scraping to structured data analysis — showcasing practical skills in data collection, cleaning, transformation, and visualization."
